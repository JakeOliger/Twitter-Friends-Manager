#Twitter Friends Manager

Helps manage who you follow on Twitter by creating an interface for categorizing them. Requires a JSON file (`src/friend-info.json`) of your followers generated by a script that I have not yet published. Additionally, there is another script not included here for fetching profile images from Twitter (`public/images`). I may eventually port them to Javascript and include them here, but for now I've just included the results of running them on my account.

This is my 2nd React project, following [Chess](https://github.com/JakeOliger/Chess).
